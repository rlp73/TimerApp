# Focus.d Timer App 
Timer logic works, circles fill in the correct sequence to track progress. 

Current problem is that the timerView only functions properly so long as the user doesn't migrate to the settings or statistics views, or close the app. Need to figure out how to keep the timer logic running regardless of the whether the user leaves the timer screen.
